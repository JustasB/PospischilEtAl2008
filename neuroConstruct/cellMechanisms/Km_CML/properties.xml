Properties associated with the Cell Mechanism which allow it to be loaded into neuroConstruct.

Note the following: 
   The Cell Mechanism name should not contain spaces and should match the name of the directory it's in
   The name and description here will be replaced by the corresponding values in a ChannelML file if found
   The filenames for the mappings are relative to the cellMechanism/(cellMechInstanceName) directory
   Mechanism Type should only have values: Channel mechanism, Synaptic mechanism, Ion concentration, Point process, Gap junction

<entry key="Description">Slow M-type K+ current for spike frequency adaptation
            
Comment from original mod file:
M-current, responsible for the adaptation of firing rate and the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) of cortical pyramidal cells
First-order model described by hodgkin-Hyxley like equations.
K+ current, activated by depolarization, noninactivating.

Model taken from Yamada, W.M., Koch, C. and Adams, P.R.  Multiple channels and calcium dynamics.  In: Methods in Neuronal Modeling, 
edited by C. Koch and I. Segev, MIT press, 1989, p 97-134.
